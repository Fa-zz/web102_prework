## Notes
Difficulties:

* I still do not entirely understand arrow functions, practically! I generally understand what is going on with them, but I need more practice before being able to write them myself "on the fly"
* Had some confusion on whether to use GAMES_DATA, GAMES_JSON. How GAMES_DATA "becomes" GAMES_JSON
* Creating and updating elements, e.g., game cards, using innerHTML and createElement()

On a better note, I do understand how to use reduce, filter etc., better than when I had previously encountered these functions
